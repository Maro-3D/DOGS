# DOGS

!!! The addon is still WIP; crashes to be expected !!!

First thing first: DOGS are not CATS!

This add-on is not intended to replace the CATS Blender add-on, so please don't consider it as such!

To install, just click the download button below. In Blender, go to **Edit** -> **Preferences** -> **Add-ons** -> **Install** and select the zip file that you downloaded.

Don't forget to enable the add-on after installing it!

This add-on enhances Blender's functionality with a focus on VR model preparation and optimization, offering features like armature creation, scene and armature statistics, mesh editing, and export options to game engines and texture software.

Big thanks to [Kaide](https://x.com/Kaideart) who provided the armatures!
